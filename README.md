## Brief Overview
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Electromagnetic waves are generated by the acceleration of charged particles. They strongly interact with matter, manifesting as X-rays, light, radio waves, and more.

Einstein, in his theory of relativity, established the foundation for this project. It aims to analyze data from LIGO using a machine learning model to predict the merger time, total mass of the system emitting gravitational waves, identify the astronomical sources of these waves, estimate the distance of objects from Earth, and assess the expected data variations resulting from changes in mass.

## History
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Historically, Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, published in 1915, predicted the existence of gravitational waves - ripples in the fabric of spacetime caused by accelerating masses. An analogy often used to explain this concept is to envision gravitational waves as analogous to waves created when you drop a rock into a calm pond, with the ripples representing the distortions in spacetime caused by massive objects in motion.


In 2015, LIGO made history by providing the first experimental proof of gravitational waves, validating a key prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity.

## Conclusion
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

### Given that the compactness ratio is less than 2, the objects in question are likely black holes.
